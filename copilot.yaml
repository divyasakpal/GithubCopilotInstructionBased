# Copilot YAML Prompt Configuration

# This file defines the primary prompts, rules, and configuration for GitHub Copilot and related agents in this repository.
# It takes precedence over markdown instruction files if there is any conflict.

# Example structure (customize as needed):

priority: 1
primary: true

override_markdown_instructions: true

rules:
  - All code generation, project structure, and workflow decisions must consult this file first.
  - If a rule in this file conflicts with a markdown instruction, this file wins.
  - Update this file to reflect the most current and critical project requirements.

# Add additional prompts, rules, or configuration below as needed.
